# Project Overview
This project evaluates the correctness and performance of the Go language by comparing the accuracy and execution time of statistical modeling using Go, Python, and R. It aims to provide company management with a reference for whether to promote Go as the unified programming language for data science.

# Testing Method
This project uses the Anscombe Quartet dataset to perform simple linear regression analyses in Go, Python, and R environments. In Python, the provided [miller-mtpa-chapter-1-program.py](miller-mtpa-chapter-1-program.py) file is used; in R, the [miller-mtpa-chapter-1-program.R](miller-mtpa-chapter-1-program.R) file is used; while in Go, a custom script is written, utilizing the [github.com/montanaflynn/stats](https://github.com/montanaflynn/stats) statistical package. Each language calculates the regression slope and intercept, and the program execution time is recorded. Go uses the go test -bench . command for benchmarking; Python scripts use the time module for timing; and R scripts use the proc.time() function to measure total runtime. The regression coefficients and execution times are compared to assess the accuracy and efficiency of Go’s statistical package.

# Regression Results Comparison
In this test, Python, R, and Go performed linear regressions on each dataset (Set I to Set IV), and obtained identical slope and intercept results.

Specific results are as follows:

Set I: Slope = 0.5001, Intercept = 3.0001

Set II: Slope = 0.5000, Intercept = 3.0009

Set III: Slope = 0.4997, Intercept = 3.0025

Set IV: Slope = 0.4999, Intercept = 3.0017

# Execution Time Comparison
Although Python, R, and Go produced consistent regression results, the time required to complete the tasks varied.

Specific execution times are:

Go program runtime: 2.358 seconds

Python program runtime: 0.036 seconds

R program runtime: 0.087 seconds

---

# Test Results Summary
In terms of result accuracy, all three languages performed equally well, producing identical slopes and intercepts, indicating their reliability in implementing standard linear regression algorithms.

However, there were significant differences in execution efficiency. Python demonstrated the best performance, completing the calculations in just about 0.036 seconds. R also performed efficiently, taking about 0.087 seconds. In contrast, Go took about 2.358 seconds to complete the same task, significantly slower than Python and R.

In summary, while all three languages ensure accuracy, Python and R offer a clear advantage in execution speed. This suggests that, compared to Go, Python and R have more mature and optimized libraries and ecosystems for statistical computing, making them better suited for such tasks.

# Recommendation to Management
Although Go achieved the same results as Python and R, it significantly lagged behind in execution time. As future projects involve larger datasets or more complex computations, this gap will become even more pronounced.

While [github.com/montanaflynn/stats](https://github.com/montanaflynn/stats) provides basic statistical functions, Go's ecosystem in data science is still in its early stages compared to Python and R. Python and R also have extensive documentation, tutorials, community support, and ready-to-use solutions. If forced to switch to Go, data scientists would spend considerable extra time seeking, learning, validating, or even developing missing tools, severely impacting the company's R&D efficiency, innovation capability, and ability to leverage cutting-edge analytical techniques.

Therefore, I do not recommend mandating the use of Go as the core language for statistical analysis and modeling at this stage. I suggest adopting a hybrid strategy: allow data scientists to continue using Python and R for exploratory analysis, model development, and research to leverage their mature ecosystems. In specific scenarios requiring deployment of models as high-performance services or tight integration with existing Go backends, Go can be explored. Meanwhile, continue monitoring the development of Go’s ecosystem in data science and regularly reassess its suitability.
